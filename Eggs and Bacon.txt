Baked bacon is much better than bacon fried in a skillet. Try it and you will be a believer.

First, heat the oven to 325 degrees F. 
Take a cookie sheet and line it with parchment paper.
Lay out your desired amount of bacon and stick it in the oven.
Go ahead and preheat your skillet to medium heat for the eggs if 
you don't want to fuss with the kitchen too much. Let the bacon
cook for 30 minutes, flipping halfway through. 

When the bacon is about 5 minutes from being done, go ahead
and drop some butter into the skillet, crack your eggs, and
drop them in too. Cook however you like. The eggs and bacon
should be done around the same time, but you may need to adjust
for your stoves heat, and how you like your eggs cooked. 

Enjoy!
