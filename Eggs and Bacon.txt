Preheat the oven to 325 degrees

Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and place desired amount of bacon onto the pan, while spacing them evenly. Put them in the oven. 

Next, go ahead and put the egg skillet on the burner on medium to medium-high heat to get the skillet preheated for the eggs later. We want the eggs to cook a little slow, we're not flash frying them. All stoves are different so if medium is too hot or not hot enough, adjust accordingly.

Bake the bacon for 30 minutes, flipping them halfway through. 

When the bacon has about 5 minutes left, go ahead and put some butter in the skillet. Crack your eggs, and add them in. For over medium, flip them as soon as you can without them falling apart. Cook on the other side for about one minute. Longer or shorter depending on the heat of your burner.

The eggs and bacon should be done right about the same time.

Enjoy!
