Put a skillet on medium-high heat.
Once hot, place two pieces of bacon into the skillet.
Cook for about 10 minutes. Less if you like soft bacon, longer if you like it crispy
flipping occasionally throughout for even cooking and straight bacon strips.

While the bacon is cooking, go ahead and prep your sandwich.
Put mayo on two slices of bread, and get ready to stage your sammy.
first put a thick slice of tomato down, and then your lettuce on top of that.
When your bacon is done, fold or break the bacon strips in half, and lay them 
on the lettuce in a "hashtag" like pattern. 

Now you can place the other piece of bread on top, flip the sandwich
so that the bacon is on bottom, and VOILA! You have yourself a BLT!
